# Find-Mismatches-using-Python-Data-Analytics
In this notebook, I use a fictional dataset to demonstrate how to find the mismatches in the implementation dataset in comparion to the prescribed matching rules from a second dataset. This is also a problem I run into very often in Data Analytics. In the notebook, there are two datasets: the one is a large dataset in which two columns denote the implementation of the modelling requirements; the other is the requirement. The goal is to test whether the implementation in the two columns strictly follows the requirements prescribed. The dataset used for this notebook is saved as "Data.xlsx" in the respository. A highlight of this notebook is the use of list comprehension and  dictionaries, which are a very tidy way in python to find mismatches in the dataset.
